For ENEE324:

The simulations that produced the graphs in our report can be made again by first going into tester.py and commenting in the section of code that will run the simulation you want to produce the graphs that you would like. Ensure that all the constants are set at the top of the page for each variable. Next run:

$ python tester.py

on the shell and a pyplot will be plotted.
